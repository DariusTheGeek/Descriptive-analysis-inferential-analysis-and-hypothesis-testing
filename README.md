# Performing Descriptive and inferential analysis on the autolib dataaset
### This project entails performing an indepth descriptive and inferential analysis on the autolib dataset whilst answering some the set research questions.

### Some of the research questions include:
1. Is the number of Bluecars taken in postal code 75015 different from Bluecars taken from postal code 75017 on weekdays?
2. Is the number of Bluecars taken in postal code 75015 different from Bluecars taken from postal code 75017 on weekends?
3. Is the number of Bluecars taken in postal code 75015 greater than Bluecars taken in postal code 75017 on weekdays?
4. Is the number of Bluecars taken in postal code 75015 less than Bluecars taken in postal code 75017 on weekends?

### The following concepts have been applied in this project:
- Defining the question, the metric for success, the context, experimental design taken and the appropriateness of the available data to     answer the given question.
- Finding and dealing with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.
- Plotting appropriate univariate and bivariate summaries and recording observations.
- Implementing solutions by performing hypothesis testing.
- Challenging solutions by providing insights on how improvements can be made.

### The dataset for this project can be found [here](http://bit.ly/DSCoreAutolibDataset) together with its [dictionary](http://bit.ly/DSCoreAutolibDatasetGlossary)

### Conclusion
From the analysis done, it was concluded that there wasn't much difference in Bluecars taken during the weekends or weekdays.

This was proven with a 95% confidence level during the hypothesis tests.
